You want to make scrambled eggs this morning.

Do you...

~p1:c1:p2
1 — Use Gordon Ramsey's recipe?
~p1:c2:p3
2 - Whip up your own thing?
~p1:c3:p4
3 - Call your friend for a recipe?

~p2
Success! The eggs are super fluffy and delicious. You are full and ready
for the day.

What do you do next? Do you...

~p2:c1:p5
1 - Wash the dishes

~p2:c2:p6
2 - Watch TV

~p3
You are not hungry this morning, but your taste buds are crying for better.

~p3:c1:p5
1 - Wash the dishes

~p3:c2:p6
2 - Watch TV

You got tied up in a conversation with your friend arguing about the
merits of your recipe vs Gordon's. As a result you spent $15 on a lame 
breakfast at the café, because you had no time to cook.

Your mother would be proud! As you start washing, your fork falls
into the sink. You go in after it and lose balance. You hit the button
for the garbage disposal. Your hand is cut to shreds, and you die. Sorry!

~p6
You turn on your favorite show - Matlock - and start chewing on some 
pretzels. In a freak accident, you choke on a pretzel and flail about
as you imagine George W. Bush would have. You die. Sorry!
